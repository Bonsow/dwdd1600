            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>Hello I am Spencer Anderson but half the people that know me just call me <strong>sticc.</strong> I have been doing design for a very long time the first time I have ever picked up a design software was way back in 2013 when I was 11. Since then I have been working on different styles of art and different programs. I started out with basic vector programs later switching to resteriztion programs such as photoshop. few years after that I switched back to vector based programs like illustrator. I have since learned some indesign, some blender, and sometimes other programs such as studio 2.0 to get a more specific look.</p>
